" noremap <silent> <C-Up> :ObviousResizeUp<CR>
" noremap <silent> <C-Down> :ObviousResizeDown<CR>
" noremap <silent> <C-Left> :ObviousResizeLeft<CR>
" noremap <silent> <C-Right> :ObviousResizeRight<CR>
"

if exists("g:loaded_obvious_resize") 
  finish
endif

" Current version
let g:loaded_obvious_resize = "1.0.0"

" Compatibility stuff handling
let s:keep_cpo = &cpo
set cpo&vim

" Define obvious resize mappings
